## Description ##
This is a simple tic tac toe Android application that I worked on with my 9 year old brother. He asked to learn about programming so we worked together on a simple project to explain how programming works. I was able to walk him through writing significant portions of the code while much I did on my own.

### Features ###
  * Win counting
