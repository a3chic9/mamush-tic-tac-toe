# mamush-tic-tac-toe
## Description
This is a simple tic tac toe Android application that I worked on with my 9 year old brother. He asked to learn about programming so we worked together on a simple project to explain how programming works. I was able to walk him through writing significant portions of the code while much I did on my own.

### Features
 * Win counting
 * Large buttons
 * Alternating start player
 * Win highlighting
 * Win count stored in preferences
